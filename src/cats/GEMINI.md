## 🏗️ **2D World Architecture**

### **Core Systems**

#### **World Coordinate System**

- **`WorldCoordinateSystem.ts`**: Central service managing 3D world coordinates and screen position mapping
- **`WorldCoordinates`**: Logical units (x, y, z) where Y=20 is cat's resting height on the ground
- **`ScreenPosition`**: Pixel coordinates with perspective scaling for rendering
- **Perspective Scaling**: Min 0.3x (far) to Max 1.4x (near) with smooth transitions
- **Responsive Floor**: Dynamically calculates floor dimensions based on viewport size

#### Single-source world-to-screen projection

- All projection goes through `worldToScreen()` and `getShadowPosition()` in `WorldCoordinateSystem.ts`.
- The cat’s shadow derives strictly from the cat’s world coordinates. No separate shadow state is kept.
- UI inputs (mouse, debug moves) use `screenPositionToWorldCoordinates()`/`screenToWorld()` to convert screen to world space.
- Grounding rule: when the cat is at resting height (Y=20), the shadow’s X and Y match the cat’s ground projection across Z.
- WORLD_DEPTH is logical; Z travel remaps to the full pixel height of the visible floor for responsive correctness.

#### **Cat Positioning Service**

- **`CatPositionServiceNew.ts`**: Manages cat movement, animations, and physics
- **`useCatPositionNew.ts`**: React hook exposing cat position data and movement functions
- **Physics-based Movement**: Smooth animations with pouncing arcs and gravity
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Prevents cat from clipping into walls (Z: 100-320 range)
- **Return-to-Rest**: Cat automatically returns to default position when idle

#### **Integrated Shadow System**

- **Dynamic Shadows**: Real-time shadow calculation based on cat's 3D position
- **Perspective-aware**: Shadow size and position adapt to cat's depth in the world
- **Height Response**: Shadows shrink when cat jumps, positioned at floor level
- **Visual Grounding**: Ensures cat always appears connected to the ground

### **World Layout**

#### **House Interior Design**

- **Back Wall**: Window with cross-frame design showing outside sky view
- **Side Furniture**: Bookshelf with multiple shelves and decorative items
- **Floor Elements**: Wooden flooring with decorative rug patterns
- **Lighting**: Soft ambient lighting creating depth and atmosphere
- **Scale**: Everything designed to work with cat's perspective scaling system

#### **Camera System**

- **Horizontal Panning**: Left/right arrow buttons for manual camera control
- **Auto-follow**: Camera smoothly tracks cat during wand toy interactions
- **Recenter Button**: Quick button to snap camera back to cat's position
- **Boundary Limits**: Camera movement constrained to world boundaries

### **User Interface Integration**

#### **Fixed UI Elements**

- **Side Panel**: Game controls remain fixed outside the world viewport
- **Currency Display**: Love and treats counters positioned above world
- **Control Buttons**: Wand toggle and camera controls at bottom of world view
- **Dev Panel**: Debug controls positioned in bottom-left corner (dev mode only)

#### **World-Embedded Elements**

- **Cat**: Fully integrated with world coordinate system and perspective
- **Wand Toy**: Moves within world space and responds to camera position
- **Hearts**: Spawn from cat and animate within the world coordinate system
- **Interactive Areas**: All click detection accounts for world coordinate mapping

### **Technical Implementation**

#### **Component Architecture**

- **`World2D.tsx`**: Main world container with camera controls and scene layout
- **`CatInteractionManager.tsx`**: Handles cat interactions within world coordinate space
- **`WandToy.tsx`**: Wand positioning and animation within world boundaries
- **CSS-based World**: All world elements positioned using absolute CSS with transforms

#### **Coordinate Mapping**

- **Screen to World**: Mouse clicks converted to world coordinates for accurate interaction
- **World to Screen**: Cat position mapped to screen pixels with perspective scaling
- **Camera Offset**: All world elements adjusted for current camera position
- **Responsive Scaling**: World size adapts to viewport dimensions while maintaining proportions

## Recent Technical Improvements

### Infinite Loop Resolution (January 2025)

Successfully identified and resolved critical infinite rendering issues:

**Root Causes Identified:**

- `useGameStateManager` was returning new object references on every render
- Achievement system dependencies on `jobLevels`/`thingQuantities` caused re-render loops
- Flawed render tracking logic was counting cumulative renders instead of render frequency

**Solutions Implemented:**

- **Memoized useGameStateManager**: Used `useMemo` to stabilize returned object references
- **Stabilized Achievement Dependencies**: Used JSON.stringify for deep comparison of state objects
- **Proper Render Loop Detection**: Replaced cumulative counter with time-based frequency monitoring
- **DOMMatrix Test Mock**: Added proper browser API mocks for test environment compatibility

**Testing Improvements:**

- Fixed 11 failing tests from 294 total tests (96% pass rate)
- Added proper test infrastructure with DOMMatrix mock
- Resolved JSX syntax errors in test files
- Implemented dynamic cat facts system for better user experience

**Code Quality:**

- ✅ Zero linting errors and warnings
- ✅ Removed all dead code and unused variables
- ✅ Added 'w' key handler for wand mode activation
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging and debugging tools

### Unified Mouse Tracking System (August 2025)

Eliminated mouse movement-induced render loops and unified all mouse tracking into a single, performant system:

**Architecture Overview:**

- **Single Event Listener**: One `document.addEventListener('mousemove')` serves entire application
- **Ref-Based State**: Mouse position stored in refs, never triggers React re-renders
- **Callback System**: Components register callbacks via `onMouseMove()` for position updates
- **Smooth Tracking**: Optional 60fps throttled position updates for animations
- **Centralized API**: All mouse-dependent features use unified `useMouseTracking` hook

**Components Integrated:**

- **Inactivity Detection**: Optimized to only update state when cats are actually sleeping/drowsy
- **Cat Eye Tracking**: Uses `smoothPositionRef` for fluid eye movement animations
- **Wand Toy Interaction**: Registers callbacks for wiggle effects and direct DOM manipulation
- **Performance Monitoring**: No longer triggers on mouse movement

**Performance Benefits:**

- ✅ **Zero render loops** during mouse movement (was 60+ renders/second)
- ✅ **Conditional state updates** only when UI actually needs to change
- ✅ **Direct DOM manipulation** for animations (bypasses React render cycle)
- ✅ **Unified event handling** eliminates redundant mouse listeners
- ✅ **Separation of concerns** between mouse tracking and render logic

**Design Principles:**

1. **Mouse tracking should never trigger React re-renders** - Use refs and callbacks
2. **State updates should be conditional** - Only update when state actually changes
3. **Direct DOM manipulation for performance-critical animations** - Bypass React for high-frequency updates
4. **Single source of truth for mouse position** - All components use unified system
5. **Callback-based subscription model** - Clean registration/cleanup of mouse listeners

**Implementation Details:**

```typescript
// Unified mouse tracking interface (ref-based, no React state)
interface MouseState {
  positionRef: React.RefObject<MousePosition>; // Current position
  lastMovementTimeRef: React.RefObject<number>; // Last movement time
  smoothPositionRef: React.RefObject<MousePosition>; // Throttled for animations
  hasRecentMovement: (thresholdMs?: number) => boolean; // Inactivity detection
  onMouseMove: (callback: Function) => () => void; // Register/cleanup callbacks
}

// Example: Optimized inactivity detection
const resetInactivityTimer = () => {
  // Only update state if it actually needs to change
  if (isSleeping) setIsSleeping(false);
  if (isDrowsy) setIsDrowsy(false);
  if (zzzs.length > 0) setZzzs([]);
  startInactivityTimers();
};
```

**Testing Coverage:**

- ✅ **12 comprehensive tests** for `useMouseTracking` hook
- ✅ **Render loop prevention verification** - confirms no state updates on mouse movement
- ✅ **Component integration tests** - `WandToy` updated for unified system
- ✅ **Callback system testing** - registration, cleanup, and multiple subscribers
- ✅ **Performance regression tests** - ensures no render loops reintroduced

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. **Follow Modular Design**: Keep data, components, and logic separated
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests for new functionality
3. **Material Design Consistency**: Use established iconography and styling patterns
4. **Performance First**: Consider impact on game loop and animation smoothness
5. **User Experience**: Maintain high information density while ensuring usability

### Code Quality Standards

- **274+ Tests**: Comprehensive coverage across all game systems including regression tests
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Full type safety and error prevention
- **ESLint Compliance**: Clean, consistent code style
- **Component Co-location**: Tests live alongside the code they test

### Architecture Principles

- **Centralized State**: GameState managed through useGameStateManager hook
- **Event-Driven Updates**: React components respond to game state changes
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic (systems) separate from UI (components) and data
- **Optimized Rendering**: Stable callbacks and minimal state updates for smooth performance
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear boundaries between data, systems, services, and components

## Refactoring Tools & Patterns

### State Management Hooks

#### useGameStateManager (`src/cats/hooks/useGameStateManager.ts`)

Centralized state mutations replacing scattered setGameState calls:

- **currency**: Methods for love/treats operations and passive income
- **jobs**: Training, promotion, and interview management
- **purchases**: Merit upgrades and thing purchases
- **debug**: Development utilities for testing

#### useStableCallback (`src/cats/hooks/useStableCallback.ts`)

Prevents infinite re-render loops by ensuring callback stability:

- **useStableCallback**: Maintains stable function references across re-renders
- **useStableHandlers**: Stable object of multiple handlers
- **Critical for**: useEffect dependencies and prop passing

### Development & Debugging Tools

#### Debug Utilities (`src/cats/utils/debugUtils.ts`)

Development-only tools for component debugging:

- **useRenderTracker**: Detects excessive re-renders and infinite loops
- **useEffectDebugger**: Tracks useEffect dependency changes
- **debugLog**: Structured console logging with categories (render, effect, callback, state)

#### Error Reporting (`src/cats/utils/errorLogger.ts` + `src/cats/components/ui/ErrorReporter.tsx`)

Automatic error capture and reporting system:

- **Console Intercepts**: Captures console.error, console.warn, and error-like logs
- **Window Error Handling**: Catches unhandled errors and promise rejections
- **Development UI**: In-app error display with copy/download functionality
- **Systematic Debugging**: Replace manual console inspection with automated logging

#### Server-Side Logging (`serverLogger`)

For debugging issues that require terminal-visible logs during development:

- **`serverLogger.log()`**: Sends log messages to the Vite development server terminal
- **Use Case**: Debugging coordinate systems, animations, and state synchronization issues
- **Best Practice**: Use sparingly for critical debugging, comment out when not needed
- **Example**: `serverLogger.log('🔴 [DEBUG] Shadow position:', shadowPosition)`
- **Terminal Output**: Messages appear in the `npm run dev` console for real-time debugging

### Refactoring Patterns Learned

#### Component Decomposition

- **Extract large components** into focused, single-responsibility components
- **Pass economy calculations** as props rather than recalculating in each component
- **Centralize interaction logic** in manager components (e.g., CatInteractionManager)

#### State Synchronization

- **Single source of truth** for each piece of state (avoid dual state systems)
- **Use refs for values** that don't need to trigger re-renders (positions, animation state)
- **Stable callback references** to prevent infinite useEffect loops

#### Performance Optimization

- **Throttle frequent updates** (love/treats changes) in achievement/notification systems
- **Memoize expensive calculations** with targeted dependencies (not entire gameState)
- **useStableCallback** for any callback passed as useEffect dependency

### Regression Testing

Comprehensive test coverage for refactoring safety:

- **App.regression.test.tsx**: Integration tests for infinite loops, dynamic content, state sync
- **useStableCallback.regression.test.ts**: Callback stability and performance tests
- **StateSynchronization.regression.test.ts**: Cross-system state consistency tests

These tools and patterns ensure the codebase remains maintainable and stable during future development.

## Achievement System Stability (August 2025)

### Duplicate Achievement Prevention

Fixed critical race condition bug where achievements could be awarded multiple times:

#### Root Cause

- **Asynchronous State Updates**: React state updates are asynchronous, so `earnedMerits` didn't update immediately
- **Rapid Succession Calls**: `checkAllAchievements` called multiple times before state propagated
- **Insufficient Guards**: Only checking `earnedMerits.includes(id)` was not sufficient for race conditions

#### Solution Implemented

```typescript
// processingAchievementsRef prevents race conditions
const processingAchievementsRef = useRef<Set<string>>(new Set());

const awardAchievement = useCallback(
  (achievement: Achievement) => {
    // FIRST: Check if currently being processed (most important check)
    if (processingAchievementsRef.current.has(achievement.id)) {
      return; // Race condition protection
    }

    // SECOND: Check if already earned
    const alreadyEarned = earnedMerits.includes(achievement.id);
    if (alreadyEarned) return;

    // Mark as processing IMMEDIATELY
    processingAchievementsRef.current.add(achievement.id);

    // Update state...

    // Remove from processing after React state propagates
    setTimeout(() => {
      processingAchievementsRef.current.delete(achievement.id);
    }, 50);
  },
  [earnedMerits, earnedAwards]
); // Include current state in dependencies
```

#### Key Principles

1. **Priority-based Protection**: Process status check comes FIRST, before state checks
2. **Immediate Tracking**: Add to processing set before any async operations
3. **Delayed Cleanup**: Allow 50ms for React state to propagate before cleanup
4. **Current State Dependencies**: Include `earnedMerits/earnedAwards` in callback dependencies

### Error Reporter Stability

Fixed infinite recursion loop in development error logger:

#### Root Cause

- **Self-logging**: Error reporter logged `"📝 Error log updated"` messages
- **Pattern Matching**: Console interceptor caught messages containing "error" keyword
- **Infinite Loop**: Each error log triggered new error logs, exponentially growing

#### Solution

```typescript
console.log = (...args) => {
  if (
    args.some((arg) => String(arg).toLowerCase().includes('error')) &&
    !args.some((arg) => String(arg).includes('🎯 [CALLBACK]')) &&
    !args.some((arg) => String(arg).includes('📝 Error log updated'))
  ) {
    // Fixed
    this.logError('log', args);
  }
  originalLog.apply(console, args);
};
```

#### Lessons Learned

- **Exclude Self-References**: Error loggers must never log their own status messages
- **Pattern Specificity**: Generic pattern matching ("error" keyword) too broad for production
- **Recursive Detection**: Always consider if logging systems can trigger themselves

### Regression Testing for Stability

Added comprehensive tests to prevent future regressions:

```typescript
// Race condition protection tests
test('prevents duplicate achievement awards - race condition protection', async () => {
  // Simulates rapid successive calls before React state updates
});

test('prevents duplicate awards when already earned', async () => {
  // Tests that already earned achievements are never re-awarded
});

test('handles rapid state changes without duplicate awards', async () => {
  // Tests rapid state changes don't bypass protection
});
```

### Dead Code Elimination

Removed unused development utilities:

- **debugUtils.ts**: `useRenderTracker` function (commented out, never used)
- **Phantom References**: Fixed linter pointing to non-existent file paths
- **Unused Variables**: Cleaned up test files with unused destructured values

These fixes ensure robust achievement awarding, stable error reporting, and cleaner codebase maintenance.
