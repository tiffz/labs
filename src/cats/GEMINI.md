# Gemini's Guide to Cat Clicker

This document outlines the vision, architecture, and implementation details for the "Cat Clicker" micro-app. It serves as a reference for future development and ensures that Gemini can easily understand and contribute to the project.

## Recent Enhancements (2025)

### Custom Cat Favicon

The Cat Clicker now features a custom SVG favicon that perfectly captures the kawaii aesthetic of the game. The favicon design process involved multiple iterations to achieve:

- **Blobby egg shape** - Wider bottom, narrower top matching the game cat's proportions
- **Frame-breaking effect** - Cat extends beyond the squarecle background for visual impact
- **Optimized positioning** - Cat positioned lower with eyes in bottom half for "peeking up" cuteness
- **Perfect proportions** - Bigger ears, larger eyes, and chunky body that feels adorable at small sizes

### Optimized Testing Workflow

The project now uses intelligent path detection to optimize development speed:

- **Code changes** trigger full test suite (139 comprehensive tests)
- **Documentation/asset changes** (like favicon tweaks) skip tests for faster deployment
- **Smart pre-commit hooks** only run tests when TypeScript/JavaScript files are staged
- **Dual CI/CD workflows** provide fast asset deployment while maintaining code quality

## 1. Core Gameplay Loop

**Cat Clicker** is an incremental game with two primary currencies:

- **Love (‚ù§Ô∏è):** Earned by interacting directly with the cat (petting, playing with the wand). Love is spent on upgrades that improve these direct interactions.
- **Treats (üêü):** Earned passively by acquiring "Day Jobs." Treats are the foundation for the game's idle progression.

The core loop is satirical and wholesome: the player must work a series of humorous day jobs not for themselves, but to provide a better life for their cat.

## 2. UI/UX Vision & Design System

The application's design is heavily inspired by **Google's Material Design 3 (M3)** system. The goal is a clean, modern, and professional UI that feels intuitive and delightful to use.

- **Layout:** The game uses a responsive two-panel layout. The left panel is for direct cat interaction, while the right panel is dedicated to the "Day Job" progression system.
- **Component Styling:** All interactive elements, such as buttons and panels, are styled according to M3 specifications, using appropriate color palettes, corner radiuses, and elevation shadows.
- **Typography & Spacing:** The application follows M3's type scale and spacing guidelines to ensure visual harmony and readability.

## 3. Key Features & Mechanics

### Cat Animation & Interaction

- **SVG Cat:** The cat is a modular SVG, allowing for individual parts like the head, tail, and eyes to be animated independently.
- **Dynamic States:** The cat has multiple states, including `petting`, `drowsy`, `sleeping`, `startled`, and `pouncing`, each with unique animations and behaviors.
- **Happy Jumps:** Rapidly petting the cat has a chance to trigger a "happy jump," which rewards bonus Love and features a joyful `^^` eye expression.

### Advanced Pounce Logic

The logic for the wand toy interaction is designed to feel organic and skillful, rewarding players who play like they would with a real cat.

- **Pounce Confidence:** The cat has an internal "pounce confidence" meter that is influenced by player actions.
- **Proximity Multiplier:** The cat becomes hyper-focused when the toy is close, dramatically amplifying the excitement from small, twitchy movements.
- **Movement Novelty:** The cat gets "bored" of repetitive, high-speed movements (like circling the mouse). To keep the cat engaged, the player must use varied, jerky motions that mimic prey.
- **Sudden Start/Stop Bonuses:** The cat is most excited by sudden changes in velocity, rewarding the player for skillful, unpredictable play.

### Dual-Currency System

- **Love (‚ù§Ô∏è):** The primary "active" currency. The main upgrades, like "More Love Per Pet," are purchased with Love.
- **Treats (üêü):** The primary "idle" currency. The `treats` counter is a passive resource that will be used for future upgrades.

### "Day Job" Progression

- **Satirical Theme:** The idle mechanic is framed as the player getting a series of absurd day jobs to earn money for their cat.
- **Progression Ladder:** Each job has multiple promotion levels (e.g., from "Unpaid Intern" to "VP of Corrugation" at the Box Factory).
- **Idle Income:** Each promotion level increases the player's passive `Treats per second`.

### Developer Mode

- **Activation:** Appending `?dev=true` to the URL activates a debug panel.
- **Live Data:** The panel provides a real-time view of the game's hidden mechanics, including the cat's `Energy`, `Pounce Confidence`, `Cursor Velocity`, `Proximity Multiplier`, and `Movement Novelty`. This was instrumental in tuning the game's feel.

### Technical Architecture

- **Multi-Page App Setup:** The project is configured as a multi-page application within Vite, with separate HTML entry points for different "labs."
- **Service Worker:** A PWA service worker is configured for offline caching. Crucially, it is set up to handle a multi-page app structure correctly, using `directoryIndex` and `ignoreURLParametersMatching` to serve the right pages and avoid caching bugs. This was a significant technical hurdle that required careful debugging.
- **Reusable Components:** Key UI elements, like the `HeartIcon` and `FishIcon`, are built as reusable React components to ensure visual consistency.

## 4. Project Structure

The `cats` micro-app follows a feature-based folder structure to keep the code organized and maintainable:

- `/components`: Contains all React components, further divided by feature.
  - `/components/cat`: Components directly related to the cat SVG and its animations (`Cat.tsx`, `Heart.tsx`, etc.).
  - `/components/jobs`: Components for the "Day Job" feature (`JobPanel.tsx`, `Job.tsx`).
  - `/components/ui`: General-purpose UI components (`DevPanel.tsx`, `CatFact.tsx`).
- `/data`: Holds static data and type definitions (`jobData.ts`, `catFacts.ts`).
- `/icons`: Contains reusable SVG icon components (`HeartIcon.tsx`, `FishIcon.tsx`).
- `/styles`: Global and component-specific stylesheets (`cats.css`).
- `/test`: Contains shared testing setup and utilities (`setupTests.ts`).

## 5. Testing

The project uses **Vitest** for unit testing, integrated directly into the Vite development environment. This allows for fast, efficient, and reliable testing of our React components. The Cat Clicker has comprehensive test coverage with **48 tests** across all major components and functionality.

### Technology Stack

- **Test Runner:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- **Testing Framework:** [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
- **DOM Assertions:** [@testing-library/jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom)
- **DOM Environment:** `jsdom`

### Running Tests

To run the entire test suite once, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will execute all `*.test.tsx` files and provide a summary of the results in the console. The tests are configured to run in a simulated DOM environment, so they do not require a browser.

### Test Coverage Overview

Our comprehensive test suite includes **48 tests** organized across three main test files:

#### **Cat Component Tests (13 tests)**

- **Eye States (7 tests):** Complete coverage of all eye expressions and states (open, sleepy, happy, startled, drowsy, blinking)
- **Eye Tracking (6 tests):** Comprehensive testing of the sophisticated eye-tracking system, including mouse following, heart tracking, animation setup, and constraints

#### **WandToy Component Tests (19 tests)**

- **Initial Rendering (3 tests):** Component setup, SVG feather rendering, and initial transforms
- **Shaking State (3 tests):** Animation state management and prop updates
- **Mouse Movement Tracking (6 tests):** Position updates, wiggle calculations, velocity factors, and directional components
- **Animation System (4 tests):** Animation frame loops, cleanup, and lifecycle management
- **Component Lifecycle (3 tests):** State persistence and initialization

#### **App Component Tests (16 tests)**

- **Wand Mode Toggle (3 tests):** Mode switching, button functionality, and state transitions
- **Wand Mode Functionality (3 tests):** Error-free operation under complex movement patterns and time progression
- **Wand Click Interaction (3 tests):** Click handling, animation triggering, and interaction feedback
- **Cleanup & State Management (2 tests):** Proper cleanup when disabling wand mode and state transition handling
- **Component Integration (3 tests):** WandToy rendering, state passing, and component lifecycle
- **System Robustness (2 tests):** Rapid mode switching and complex interaction sequences

### Test Philosophy

- **Co-location:** Test files (`*.test.tsx`) are located directly alongside the component file they are testing (e.g., `Cat.test.tsx` lives next to `Cat.tsx`). This makes tests easy to find and encourages testing as part of the development workflow. Shared testing setup resides in the `/test` directory.
- **Behavior-Driven:** Our tests are written to verify the component's behavior from a user's perspective, rather than its internal implementation details. For example, we test that the correct eyes _appear_ on screen based on the component's props, not that a specific internal state variable is set.
- **Functional Focus:** Tests focus on **what the system does** rather than **how it does it internally**. This makes tests resistant to refactoring and ensures they catch real functional regressions.
- **Error Prevention:** Tests use `expect().not.toThrow()` patterns to catch runtime errors and ensure robust operation under complex conditions.

### Advanced Testing Techniques

Our test suite employs sophisticated mocking and testing strategies:

- **Portal Mocking:** `ReactDOM.createPortal` is mocked to handle heart rendering in tests
- **Animation Mocking:** `requestAnimationFrame`, `DOMMatrix`, and `getComputedStyle` are mocked for testing animated components
- **Timer Control:** Fake timers with `vi.useFakeTimers()` for precise control over time-based interactions
- **DOM Environment Setup:** Proper cleanup and setup of DOM elements (like `heart-container`) required by the application

### Regression Prevention

The primary goal of our test suite is to prevent regressions:

- **Eye Tracking Bug Prevention:** The detailed eye-tracking tests were specifically created after a regression where the cat's eyes stopped following hearts, ensuring this sophisticated feature never breaks again
- **Wand Toy System Protection:** Comprehensive coverage of the complex pouncing mechanics, including proximity calculations, movement novelty, and velocity detection
- **State Management Validation:** Tests ensure proper cleanup, state transitions, and component lifecycle management under all conditions

### CI/CD Integration

Tests are integrated into the development workflow:

- **Pre-commit Hooks:** All tests must pass before commits are allowed
- **Continuous Integration:** GitHub Actions runs the full test suite on every push and pull request
- **Deployment Blocking:** Failed tests prevent deployment to production

## 6. Modern Architecture (2024 Updates)

This section documents major architectural improvements and lessons learned from recent refactoring sessions, ensuring future development follows established patterns and avoids known pitfalls.

### Clean Architecture Principles

The Cat Clicker now follows a **Clean Architecture** pattern with clear separation of concerns:

#### **Game State Layer (Pure Business Logic)**

- **File:** `src/cats/game/GameState.ts`
- **Purpose:** Contains pure business logic for cat behavior, pounce calculations, and wand interactions
- **Key Features:**
  - No React dependencies
  - Pure functions and state management
  - Event-driven communication with other layers
  - Testable in isolation

#### **Animation Controller Layer (Pure Presentation)**

- **File:** `src/cats/animation/AnimationController.ts`
- **Purpose:** Manages visual effects, timing, and animation orchestration
- **Key Features:**
  - Handles visual timing without knowing game rules
  - Manages cat-specific animations (pouncing, ear wiggling, etc.)
  - Timer and animation frame management
  - Clean separation from business logic

#### **React Integration Layer**

- **File:** `src/cats/hooks/useCatSystem.ts`
- **Purpose:** Bridges pure game logic with React component state
- **Key Features:**
  - Event-driven state synchronization
  - Stable callback management
  - Performance-optimized updates
  - Prevents infinite re-render loops

### Unified Heart Spawning System

#### **Architecture Decision**

We implemented a centralized `HeartSpawningService` to eliminate code duplication and create consistent heart behavior across different interaction types.

- **File:** `src/cats/services/HeartSpawningService.ts`
- **Problem Solved:** Previously, petting hearts and pouncing hearts had separate, inconsistent spawning logic
- **Benefits:**
  - Single source of truth for heart calculations
  - Consistent scaling based on love amount
  - Configurable visual behaviors per interaction type
  - Performance optimization with heart count limits

#### **Interaction-Specific Configurations**

**Petting Hearts (Gentle & Calm):**

- 100ms delays between hearts
- Tighter grouping (1.0x spread)
- Slower animation (1.2s duration)
- Standard float velocity

**Pouncing Hearts (Fast & Energetic):**

- 50ms delays between hearts
- More scattered (1.5x spread)
- Faster animation (0.8s duration)
- Increased float velocity (1.3x)

#### **Smart Heart Scaling**

- Heart count: 1 heart per 2.5 love (minimum 1, maximum 5)
- Heart size: Logarithmic scaling based on love amount
- Performance: Capped at 5 hearts to prevent lag

### Click Excitement System

#### **Problem Statement**

The original wand system felt too "clicky" rather than skill-based. Users wanted a more formula-driven interaction that rewards timing and proximity.

#### **Solution: Dual Confidence System**

We implemented separate tracking for movement-based and click-based excitement:

**Click Excitement (`clickExcitement`):**

- Builds from wand clicks scaled by proximity
- Time-based decay (starts after 500ms delay)
- Contributes 30% to overall pounce confidence
- Caps at 100 points for balance

**Movement Confidence (`pounceConfidence`):**

- Builds from wand movement patterns
- Influenced by velocity changes and novelty
- Combined with click excitement for total confidence
- Triggers pounces when threshold is reached

#### **Benefits**

- More reactive feel (clicks work anywhere on screen)
- Formula-based rather than direct "click to pounce"
- Proximity matters (distant clicks less effective)
- Transparent via debug panel for tuning

### React State Management Lessons

#### **Critical Learning: Infinite Re-render Prevention**

During this refactoring, we encountered and solved several infinite re-render scenarios. These patterns should be avoided:

**‚ùå Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**

```typescript
// DON'T: Frequent state updates in useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  setStateEveryFrame(newValue); // Causes infinite loops
}, [frequentlyChangingValue]);

// DON'T: Unstable callback dependencies
const callback = () => {
  /* logic */
}; // Recreated every render
useEffect(() => {
  setupSystem(callback);
}, [callback]); // Infinite loop

// DON'T: Direct DOM manipulation triggering state
useEffect(() => {
  element.addEventListener('event', () => {
    setState(newValue); // Can cause loops
  });
}, []);
```

**‚úÖ Preferred Patterns:**

```typescript
// DO: Event-driven state updates
const forceUpdate = useCallback(() => {
  setReactState(gameState.getReactState());
}, []);

// DO: Stable callbacks with useCallback
const stableCallback = useCallback((data) => {
  // Handle data
}, []); // Empty deps when truly stable

// DO: Ref-based access in animations
const valueRef = useRef(value);
useEffect(() => {
  const animate = () => {
    // Use valueRef.current to avoid dependencies
    doAnimation(valueRef.current);
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  };
  animate();
}, []); // Minimal dependencies
```

#### **State Synchronization Strategy**

- **Game Logic:** Pure state management outside React
- **React State:** Only for triggering re-renders
- **Event Callbacks:** Bridge between layers
- **Performance:** Update React state only when UI needs to change

### Testing Architecture Improvements

#### **New Test Categories Added**

1. **HeartSpawningService Tests (15 tests):** Comprehensive coverage of unified heart system
2. **Click Excitement System Tests (19 tests):** Complete coverage of new click mechanics
3. **Petting/Wand Integration Tests (17 tests):** Prevention of mode-switching bugs

#### **Testing Philosophy Reinforced**

- **Co-location:** Tests live next to the code they test
- **Behavior-driven:** Test what users experience, not internal implementation
- **Async-aware:** Proper handling of timeouts and delayed effects
- **Regression prevention:** Tests specifically designed to catch known failure modes

### Performance Optimizations

#### **DOM Manipulation Strategy**

- **High-frequency updates:** Direct DOM manipulation (pupil tracking)
- **Infrequent updates:** React state updates (mode changes, pouncing)
- **Animation loops:** `requestAnimationFrame` with ref-based access
- **Memory management:** Proper cleanup of timers and event listeners

#### **Heart Rendering Optimization**

- **Performance caps:** Maximum 5 hearts per spawn
- **Staggered timing:** Delayed spawning prevents frame drops
- **Portal rendering:** Hearts rendered outside main component tree
- **Automatic cleanup:** Hearts remove themselves after animation

### Development Workflow Improvements

#### **Build & Quality Assurance**

- **Linting:** ESLint with TypeScript rules enforced
- **Build verification:** All builds must complete successfully
- **Test coverage:** 112+ tests across all major systems
- **Type safety:** Strict TypeScript configuration

#### **Debugging Tools**

- **Dev panel:** Real-time visibility into click excitement and pounce confidence
- **Debug logging:** Structured logging for state transitions (removable)
- **Component inspection:** React DevTools integration
- **Performance monitoring:** Animation frame rate tracking

### Future Architecture Guidelines

#### **When Adding New Features:**

1. **Separate concerns:** Keep game logic, animation, and React separate
2. **Event-driven:** Use callbacks for cross-layer communication
3. **Test first:** Write tests that prevent regressions
4. **Performance conscious:** Consider high-frequency vs low-frequency updates
5. **User-focused:** Design APIs around user interactions, not internal convenience

#### **When Refactoring:**

1. **Preserve interfaces:** Keep public APIs stable during internal changes
2. **Incremental approach:** Change one layer at a time
3. **Test coverage:** Ensure tests pass at each step
4. **Monitor performance:** Watch for regressions in animation smoothness
5. **Document decisions:** Update this file with learnings

### Technical Debt Management

#### **Resolved in This Session:**

- ‚úÖ Unified heart spawning (eliminated code duplication)
- ‚úÖ Click excitement system (improved user experience)
- ‚úÖ Infinite re-render loops (architectural fixes)
- ‚úÖ Test coverage gaps (comprehensive new tests)
- ‚úÖ Linting issues (code quality improvements)

#### **Ongoing Considerations:**

- Monitor animation performance as features are added
- Consider caching strategies for heart spawning
- Evaluate state management scaling as game grows
- Regular performance auditing of animation loops

This architecture has proven stable and performant through multiple refactoring sessions and should serve as the foundation for future development.
