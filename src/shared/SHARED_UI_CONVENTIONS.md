# Shared UI Conventions

This document defines default conventions for shared UI so apps stay naturally aligned by default while still supporting app-specific identity.

## Objectives

- Shared controls should be easy to theme and hard to accidentally break.
- App teams should override tokens, not internals.
- Defaults should encode the non-load-bearing UX decisions (spacing, typography scale, state behavior, focus treatment).

## Theme Contract (Default)

All music apps and `/ui` should publish the same semantic contract, then map app identity into these variables:

- **Brand + text**
  - `--theme-primary`, `--theme-primary-hover`, `--theme-accent`
  - `--theme-text`, `--theme-text-secondary`, `--theme-text-muted`
- **Surfaces**
  - `--theme-bg`, `--theme-surface`, `--theme-surface-elevated`
  - `--theme-border`, `--theme-border-strong`, `--theme-focus-ring`
- **Elevation + shape**
  - `--theme-shadow-sm`, `--theme-shadow-md`, `--theme-shadow-lg`
  - `--theme-radius-sm`, `--theme-radius-md`, `--theme-radius-lg`

Legacy app tokens (`--primary`, `--piano-primary`, `--accent-primary`, etc.) can remain, but should alias into the semantic contract during migration.

## Scale Buckets (Required)

### Spacing scale

Use a 4px base grid:

- `--space-1: 4px`
- `--space-2: 8px`
- `--space-3: 12px`
- `--space-4: 16px`
- `--space-5: 20px`
- `--space-6: 24px`
- `--space-8: 32px`

### Typography scale

- `--font-size-xs`, `--font-size-sm`, `--font-size-md`, `--font-size-lg`, `--font-size-xl`
- `--font-weight-regular`, `--font-weight-medium`, `--font-weight-semibold`, `--font-weight-bold`

### Control size buckets

Shared interactive controls should support these buckets:

- `compact`
  - input/button height target: `32px`
  - intended for dense sidebars and chip-heavy flows
- `comfortable` (default)
  - input/button height target: `38px`
  - intended for most pages and gallery defaults
- `touch`
  - input/button height target: `44px`
  - intended for touch-first flows

Bucket-specific values should be expressed via variables, not one-off per-component pixel overrides.

## Grid and Layout Conventions

- Prefer responsive grids with `minmax()` and tokenized gaps:
  - `gap: var(--space-3)` / `var(--space-4)`
  - `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(240px, 1fr))` for demo cards by default
- Prefer tokenized max widths for control groups (`--control-max-width`) rather than repeating literal widths across apps.
- Avoid 1-2px local nudges unless there is a measured visual regression that cannot be solved by a bucket variable.

## Design Principles

- **Parity First**: `/ui` should mirror production component composition, not just token snapshots.
- **Wrapper-Aware Rendering**: when app styling depends on wrapper classes, gallery examples should include those wrappers.
- **Single Source Theme Ownership**: shared-control tokens should live in one owner (`appSharedThemes.css` preferred), with app CSS only for truly local layout needs.
- **Portal Safety by Default**: dropdown/popover visuals must be explicitly themed on paper/root hooks and never rely on parent inheritance.
- **Composable with Guardrails**: components should expose root + dropdown hooks and token families so app identity can vary without brittle deep selector overrides.

## Convention Layers

- **Layer 1: Shared defaults**
  - Shared components ship with complete defaults for spacing, sizing, typography, focus states, and interaction rhythm.
  - A component should look production-ready without any app overrides.

- **Layer 2: App appearance contract**
  - Components that support app profile styling expose an `appearance` prop (for example: `default`, `chords`, `piano`, `words`).
  - Appearance applies broad theme intent and should avoid app-specific one-offs.

- **Layer 3: Token overrides**
  - App code customizes via documented CSS custom properties (token families like `--cp-*`, `--cs-*`, `--key-*`, `--bpm-*`).
  - Portal content (popover/dropdown) must be themed with dropdown class hooks, not root-only selectors.

## Required Theming API for New Shared Components

- Root class for control shell.
- Class hook for portal/dropdown/popup surface.
- Token family with at least:
  - input/shell tokens,
  - focus tokens,
  - surface tokens,
  - interactive item/chip state tokens.
- Optional `appearance` prop when the component is reused across multiple app families.

## Override Rules

- Prefer tokens first.
- Use class hooks second.
- Avoid deep selector overrides unless changing layout structure.
- If deep selector override is unavoidable, document why near the override and in this file's changelog section.
- Choose one owner per app override path (`appSharedThemes.css` or app stylesheet), and avoid duplicating the same selector contract in both.

## Density and Typography Defaults

- Shared controls should default to:
  - `comfortable` density,
  - consistent line-height and click target sizing,
  - medium emphasis on selected labels and clear hierarchy for title/meta text.
- App overrides can tune density (`compact` / `comfortable` / `touch`), but should preserve legibility and interaction affordances.

## UI Gallery Requirement

- Every shared UI component should have a `/ui` gallery example that includes:
  - default state,
  - disabled or constrained state when relevant,
  - app appearance variants (if supported),
  - at least one edge-state demo (compact width, long content, or mobile viewport).

## Test Requirement

- For each shared UI component family, add at least one UI-focused integration test path.
- Appearance and dropdown class API hooks must be covered by tests.

- [ ] Snapshot or integration coverage added.
- [ ] README/dev docs updated with usage notes.

## Linear volume slider (0–1)

For **mix rails and other linear 0–1 gain** controls, use `AppLinearVolumeSlider` (`src/shared/components/AppLinearVolumeSlider.tsx`) instead of raw MUI `Slider` copies. It wraps MUI with defaults (`min={0}`, `max={1}`, `step={0.02}`, `size="small"`) and **keeps vertical padding** on the Slider root so **clicks on the middle of the visible rail** still hit MUI’s input (zeroing `py` in dense layouts commonly breaks rail jumps).

`AppSlider` remains the older **legacy event-shape** helper for BPM and similar; prefer `AppLinearVolumeSlider` for new **volume / gain** UX.

## Popover Primitive

Apps historically re-specified MUI `Popover`'s `anchorOrigin`, `transformOrigin`, and `slotProps.paper.className` at every call site, which drifted over time. Use `AnchoredPopover` (`src/shared/components/AnchoredPopover.tsx`) for any new popover or menu surface.

```tsx
<AnchoredPopover
  open={open}
  anchorEl={anchorEl}
  onClose={onClose}
  placement="bottom-end"
  paperClassName="mixer-popover"
>
  {children}
</AnchoredPopover>
```

Migrate existing MUI `Popover` usages opportunistically (i.e. when touching the surrounding code). `SharedExportPopover` should eventually adopt this primitive as well; it remains on direct `Popover` usage for now because it carries its own theming contract.

## LabsDebugDock (URL-gated debug chrome)

For local-only debug surfaces (e.g. practice timelines), wrap app-specific content in `LabsDebugDock` from [`src/shared/components/LabsDebugDock.tsx`](./components/LabsDebugDock.tsx). It provides a consistent bottom dock, collapse affordance, optional **Copy bundle** (JSON for bug reports / LLM paste), and an optional `reportOuterHeightCssVar` hook when the main app layout must subtract dock height (see scales `--debug-panel-height`).

## App-specific shared primitives

Some primitives live under `src/<app>/ui/` rather than `src/shared/components/` because their data shapes are app-specific, but they should still be discoverable from this conventions doc.

### Encore

- **`src/encore/ui/EncoreMediaLinkRow.tsx`** — single row primitive for displaying an `EncoreMediaLink` (Spotify, YouTube, or Drive chart). Encapsulates the icon + caption + optional primary star + optional open + optional remove affordances. Used by `SongPage` for reference recordings, backing tracks, and chart attachments. Use this instead of hand-rolling another media-link strip; if you find yourself rendering a list of `EncoreMediaLink` anywhere new (e.g. PracticeScreen, GuestShareView), wrap each row in this primitive so spacing and accessibility stay consistent. The "Make primary <slot>" tooltip/aria-label copy is centralized in this file (see [`src/encore/COPY_STYLE.md`](../encore/COPY_STYLE.md) § _Primary-star affordance_).
- **`src/encore/ui/EncoreStreamingHoverCard.tsx`** — hover popover that resolves a Spotify/YouTube link into title + artist via the appropriate API (Spotify Web API, YouTube oEmbed). Wrap any `EncoreMediaLinkRow` (or any other Spotify/YouTube link) in this hover card to give users at-a-glance metadata without leaving the page. Caches results for the session.
- **`src/encore/ui/EncoreSpotifyTrackListRow.tsx`** — album art + title + artist row, used by `renderSpotifyTrackAutocompleteOption` and the manual Spotify picker inside `PlaylistImportDialog` so search results look identical everywhere a Spotify track is offered. Use this for any new Spotify search/result list.
- **`IntegrationCard` (inside `src/encore/components/EncoreAccountMenu.tsx`)** — parallel layout for every third-party connection (Google, Spotify, …) with slots for status pill, identity, description, utility icon row, primary action (`Sign in again`), inline secondary (e.g. `Retry sync`), tertiary `Disconnect`, and an optional `Alert`. Any new connection added to the account menu **must** route through this component instead of hand-rolling its own card; see [`src/encore/COPY_STYLE.md`](../encore/COPY_STYLE.md) § _Account integrations_ for the canonical strings and [STYLE_GUIDE.md](../../STYLE_GUIDE.md) § _Parallel surfaces for parallel concepts_ for the rationale.
- **`src/encore/ui/EncoreFilterChipBar.tsx`** — chip bar primitive used by `LibraryRepertoireFiltersPanel` and `SavedSearchesManageScreen`. Field configs opt in to **NOT IN / exclude** semantics by setting `supportsExclude: true`; the menu then renders a `Match` / `Exclude` segmented toggle and the chip flips to the error-tinted negated form. See [STYLE_GUIDE.md](../../STYLE_GUIDE.md) § _Filter / search operators_ for the contract.
- **`src/encore/ui/EncoreSynchronizableSpotifyPlaylistPanel.tsx`** — single source of truth for any UI that lets a user bind a Spotify playlist and trigger sync. Used by the Practice page (learning playlist) and `SavedSearchesManageScreen` (saved-search → playlist binding). Resolves the live playlist _name_ from Spotify (caller passes `spotifyClientId` + the saved id), surfaces context-aware tooltips for disabled-Sync states, and renders one Spotify mark — never two — by placing the brand inside the row chip (summary mode) or the `EncoreBrandTextField` (edit mode), not in a section-label prefix. Add new sync screens by passing different `helpContent` / `syncReadyTooltip` rather than hand-rolling another inline layout, so polish on either screen benefits both.
- **`src/encore/ui/EncoreBrandTextField.tsx`** — `TextField` whose start adornment is a brand mark (`spotify`, `youtube`, …). Use this whenever the field accepts a brand-specific URL or id. Don't double up: if your section header already shows the brand mark, route the input through `EncoreSynchronizableSpotifyPlaylistPanel` (or skip the `brand` prop) instead of stacking two icons on the same row.
