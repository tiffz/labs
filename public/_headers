# Cache control headers for all micro apps
# Note: GitHub Pages doesn't support _headers files, but this is useful for other platforms
# For GitHub Pages, cache busting is handled via:
# 1. Hash-based filenames in Vite build (already configured)
# 2. Service worker NetworkFirst strategy for HTML (configured in vite.config.ts)
# 3. Cache-control meta tags in HTML files

# Don't cache HTML files - always fetch fresh
